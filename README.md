# Nocker

## Introduction

Nocker is a lightweight command line interface that allows interaction with the default Docker development environment. Nocker is an excellent starting point to create a NodeJS application using **Postgres**, **MySQL**, **Redis** and **EventStore** without the need for prior Docker experience.

The nocker script provides a CLI with convenient methods to interact with the Docker containers defined by the `docker-compose.yml` file.
